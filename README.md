Hi Ahamove team's

This is my answer for the test

Both of these test I've use Nodejs. Here is the description for the test:

1. Run program with command `node RemoveDuplicates`
2. Run program with command `node BillDivision`. Input program with 3 row as the testcase. Each row end with enter.

I've write down the answer of `How about the AhaMove web app?` on the file name `AhamoveThoght`.

Note: Install NodeJS if it's not exist in your machine

Thank you for your review on this.
